# QBI_Project
Project using tree-based methods to create a model that indentifies the key factors that cause a National Football League (NFL) quarterback to throw an interception

## Code
I used R markdown to create the code used for the model.

## Data Source
I got the data from pro-footballreference.com. I 12 seasons' worth of statistics and then cleaned the data to come up with a final dataset of 107 quarterbacks' single season statistics. More details about the cleaning process are available in the "QB_Interception Results" file.
